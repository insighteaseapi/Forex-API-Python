## Installation

### Necessities
Make sure Python is installed; it is advised to use Python 3.6 or later. Install the necessary dependencies next:

#### Necessary Library
**Requests**: Making HTTP calls to the API and managing their answers are done with this library.

Use the following command to install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install requests
```

## Application
To make API requests and retrieve FX data, run the main script:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Use Case Example
An example request to retrieve the most recent GBP/CHF pricing is as follows:
```python
from insight_forex import insightForex

forex_api = insightForex(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
latest_price = forex_api.get_latest_price("GBP/CHF")
print("Latest Price of GBP/CHF:", latest_price)
```

## Notes
- In order to manage API calls, the **requests** library is necessary.
- Rather than being hardcoded, the API key ought to be safely saved.
- Verify that the API base URL is accurate and current.
- Since the return format is JSON, processing and parsing must be done correctly.
