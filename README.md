## Installation ### Necessities
Make sure Python is installed; it is advised to use Python 3.6 or later. Install the necessary dependencies next:

#### Necessary Library
**Requests**: Making HTTP calls to the API and managing their answers are done with this library.

Use the following command to install the dependencies: ```sh pip install requests ```

## Application
To make API requests and retrieve FX data, run the main script:
```sh main.py in Python

## Use Case Example
An example request to retrieve the most recent GBP/CHF pricing is as follows:
Python ```python import insightForex from insight_forex

insightForex(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY') = forex_api
forex_api.get_latest_price("GBP/CHF") = latest_price
"Latest Price of GBP/CHF:", latest_price, print() ```

## Notes: In order to manage API calls, the **requests** library is necessary.
Rather than being hardcoded, the API key ought to be safely saved.
Verify that the API base URL is accurate and current.
Since the return format is JSON, processing and parsing must be done correctly.

## Permit
